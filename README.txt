This project was built with Java 8.
More specifically: "1.8.0_271"

The entry point for the application is in source/labyrinth/controllers/MainMenuController.java

The "root" of the application must be a folder one above the source folder (the source folder containing labyrinth/ and resources/), as otherwise image URLs may not work.

Apologies for the lack of exact compile instructions.
